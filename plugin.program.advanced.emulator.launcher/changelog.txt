         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2582004#pid2582004

FEATURE  Support Redump DAT files. Note that Redump does not include Parent/Clone data so all
         ROMs are Parent ROMs.

FEATURE  New platform Panasonic 3DO.

FEATURE  Update NFO files after scraping. This is useful to interrupt the scanner when scanning
         large collections and resume scanning later.
         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2548998#pid2548998

FEATURE  Allow only one instance of AEL running at a time.
         This prevents multiple launcher execution and also get rids forever of any database
         corruption issues due to concurrency! Thanks Roman_V_M for ideas about the fix.
         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=310697

FIX      Fixed crash when displaying a Launcher in Parent/Clone view with Unknown ROMs.

[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.9.6-beta1 | 5 March 2017[/B]

FEATURE  Import and Export of Launchers configurations. Will be very useful especially for 
         Android users.

FEATURE  Use a Window property to let skins know wheter a launcher OR ROMs are being rendered.
         Set xbmcgui.Window(10001).setProperty('AEL_Content', 'launchers')
             xbmcgui.Window(10001).setProperty('AEL_Content', 'roms')
         It must be set on entering and unset on exiting the plugin.

FEATURE  Use setProperty() to inform the skin about ROM flags:
           1) Favourite status: OK, Unlinked ROM, Unlinked Launcher, Broken
           2) No-Intro status: Have, Missing, Added, Unknown
           3) Parent/Clone status: Parent or Clone (Boolean)

         For example:
           setProperty('AEL_Fav_stat',     'Fav_OK')
           setProperty('AEL_NoIntro_stat', 'NoIntro_Have')
           setProperty('AEL_PClone_stat',  'PClone_Parent')

         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2500040#pid2500040

FEATURE  Update launching mechanism. User Python subprocess module on all platforms and not the
         deprecated os.system(). Current patched subprocess_hack module is from Python 2.4. Current 
         Python version in Kodi is 2.7.
         os.system(), os.open(), etc. are deprecated, and the subprocess module should be used 
         instead for all platforms. A parser of arguments must be coded in order to use the 
         subprocess module.

FEATURE  Log emulator/standalone launcher stdout/stderr into a file. Requires new launching
         mechanism based on subprocess module. Have a look to AML for an implementation.

FEATURE  Add nplayers metadata field to ROMs. Billyc999 database has nplayers NFO.
         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2407055#pid2407055

         implementation.
         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2495480#pid2495480

         AL ROM scanner only added the first disc to the database and skipped disc numbers
         from 2 to 9.
         https://github.com/Wintermute0110/plugin.program.advanced.launcher/blob/master/resources/lib/launcher_plugin.py#L2088

         At ROM launching, if any of the strings ['.cd1', '-cd1', '_cd1', ' cd1'] is found on the
         ROMfile basename then the rompath was scanned looking for all the discs. User selected
         the disc number to launch from a select dialog.
         https://github.com/Wintermute0110/plugin.program.advanced.launcher/blob/master/resources/lib/launcher_plugin.py#L1688

         AEL will use a better implementation based on a ROM filename parser. See NOTES.md

         %rom% becomes $rom$

FIX      Added new argument substitution keywords $rombasenoext$, $categoryID$, $launcherID$,
         and $romID$.

FEATURE  New Arcade Database online metadata/asset scraper for MAME ROMs.

FEATURE  Support for several arguments in launcher. This will be useful when using MAME for
         console emulation (MAME consoles from a different region have different names, and an
         European console will typically refuse to run a Japanese game).
         Survey about this: http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2467547#pid2467547

FEATURE  New command SHOW_ALL_ROMS to render all ROMs in all launchers. Will be used by skins.

         scraping.
